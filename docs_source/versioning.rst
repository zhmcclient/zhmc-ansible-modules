.. _`Versioning`:

Versioning
==========

This collection uses the rules of `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0`_ for its version.

.. _Semantic Versioning 2.0.0: http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html

This documentation may have been built from a development level of the
package. You can recognize a development version of this package by the
presence of a ".devD" suffix in the version string.


.. _`Compatibility`:

Compatibility
-------------

For Ansible modules, compatibility is always seen from the perspective of an
Ansible playbook using it. Thus, a backwards compatible new version of an
Ansible Galaxy collection means that the user can safely upgrade to that new
version without encountering compatibility issues in any Ansible playbooks
using the modules in the collection.

This collection uses the rules of `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0`_ for compatibility
between package versions, and for :ref:`deprecations <Deprecations>`.

The public interface of the collection that is subject to the semantic
versioning rules (and specificically to its compatibility rules) are the Ansible
module interfaces described in this documentation.

Violations of these compatibility rules are described in section
:ref:`Releases`.


.. _`Deprecations`:

Deprecations
------------

Deprecated functionality is marked accordingly in this documentation and in the
:ref:`Releases` section.
