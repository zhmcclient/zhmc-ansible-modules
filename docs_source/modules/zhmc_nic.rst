zhmc_nic -- Create NICs in partitions
=====================================



.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------
- Create, update, or delete a NIC (virtual Network Interface Card) in a partition of a CPC (Z system).
- Note that the Ansible module zhmc_partition can be used to gather facts about existing NICs of a partition.





Parameters
----------


     
hmc_host
  The hostname or IP address of the HMC.


  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


     
hmc_auth
  The authentication credentials for the HMC, as a dictionary of ``userid``, ``password``.


  | **required**: True
  | **type**: dict


     
  userid
    The userid (username) for authenticating with the HMC.


    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str


     
  password
    The password for authenticating with the HMC.


    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str



     
cpc_name
  The name of the CPC with the partition containing the NIC.


  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


     
partition_name
  The name of the partition containing the NIC.


  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


     
name
  The name of the target NIC that is managed. If the NIC needs to be created, this value becomes its name.


  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


     
state
  The desired state for the target NIC:

  ``absent``: Ensures that the NIC does not exist in the specified partition.

  ``present``: Ensures that the NIC exists in the specified partition and has the specified properties.


  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str
  | **choices**: absent, present


     
properties
  Dictionary with input properties for the NIC, for ``state=present``. Key is the property name with underscores instead of hyphens, and value is the property value in YAML syntax. Integer properties may also be provided as decimal strings. Will be ignored for ``state=absent``.

  The possible input properties in this dictionary are the properties defined as writeable in the data model for NIC resources (where the property names contain underscores instead of hyphens), with the following exceptions:

  * ``name``: Cannot be specified because the name has already been specified in the ``name`` module parameter.

  * ``network_adapter_port_uri`` and ``virtual_switch_uri``: Cannot be specified because this information is specified using the artificial properties ``adapter_name`` and ``adapter_port``.

  * ``adapter_name``: The name of the adapter that has the port backing the target NIC. Used for all adapter families (ROCE, OSA, Hipersockets).

  * ``adapter_port``: The port index of the adapter port backing the target NIC. Used for all adapter families (ROCE, OSA, Hipersockets).

  Properties omitted in this dictionary will remain unchanged when the NIC already exists, and will get the default value defined in the data model for NICs when the NIC is being created.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: dict


     
log_file
  File path of a log file to which the logic flow of this module as well as interactions with the HMC are logged. If null, logging will be propagated to the Python root logger.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


     
_faked_session
  An internal parameter used for testing the module.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: raw




Examples
--------

   ---
   # Note: The following examples assume that some variables named 'my_*' are set.

   - name: Ensure NIC exists in the partition
     zhmc_partition:
       hmc_host: "{{ my_hmc_host }}"
       hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"
       cpc_name: "{{ my_cpc_name }}"
       partition_name: "{{ my_partition_name }}"
       name: "{{ my_nic_name }}"
       state: present
       properties:
         adapter_name: "OSD 0128 A13B-13"
         adapter_port: 0
         description: "The port to our data network"
         device_number: "023F"
     register: nic1

   - name: Ensure NIC does not exist in the partition
     zhmc_partition:
       hmc_host: "{{ my_hmc_host }}"
       hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"
       cpc_name: "{{ my_cpc_name }}"
       partition_name: "{{ my_partition_name }}"
       name: "{{ my_nic_name }}"
       state: absent










Return Values
-------------


   changed
        Indicates if any change has been made by the module. For ``state=facts``, always will be false.


        | **returned**: always
        | **type**: bool



   msg
        An error message that describes the failure.


        | **returned**: failure
        | **type**: str



   nic
        For ``state=absent``, an empty dictionary.

        For ``state=present``, the resource properties of the NIC after any changes.


        | **returned**: success
        | **type**: dict

        **sample**: ::

                  {"adapter-id": "128", "adapter-name": "OSD_128_MGMT_NET2_30", "adapter-port": 0, "class": "nic", "description": "HAMGMT", "device-number": "0004", "element-id": "5956e97a-f433-11ea-b67c-00106f239d19", "element-uri": "/api/partitions/32323df4-f433-11ea-b67c-00106f239d19/nics/5956e97a-f433-11ea-b67c-00106f239d19", "mac-address": "02:d2:4d:80:b9:88", "name": "HAMGMT0", "parent": "/api/partitions/32323df4-f433-11ea-b67c-00106f239d19", "ssc-ip-address": null, "ssc-ip-address-type": null, "ssc-management-nic": false, "ssc-mask-prefix": null, "type": "osd", "virtual-switch-uri": "/api/virtual-switches/db2f0bec-e578-11e8-bd0a-00106f239c31", "vlan-id": null, "vlan-type": null}
