zhmc_cpc -- Update CPCs
=======================



.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------
- Gather facts about a CPC (Z system), including its adapters, partitions, and storage groups.
- Update the properties of a CPC.





Parameters
----------


     
hmc_host
  The hostname or IP address of the HMC.


  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


     
hmc_auth
  The authentication credentials for the HMC, as a dictionary of ``userid``, ``password``.


  | **required**: True
  | **type**: dict


     
  userid
    The userid (username) for authenticating with the HMC.


    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str


     
  password
    The password for authenticating with the HMC.


    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str



     
name
  The name of the target CPC.


  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


     
state
  The desired state for the attachment:

  * ``set``: Ensures that the CPC has the specified properties.

  * ``facts``: Does not change anything on the CPC and returns the CPC properties including its child resources.


  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str
  | **choices**: set, facts


     
properties
  Only for ``state=set``: New values for the properties of the CPC. Properties omitted in this dictionary will remain unchanged. This parameter will be ignored for ``state=facts``.

  The parameter is a dictionary. The key of each dictionary item is the property name as specified in the data model for CPC resources, with underscores instead of hyphens. The value of each dictionary item is the property value (in YAML syntax). Integer properties may also be provided as decimal strings.

  The possible properties in this dictionary are the properties defined as writeable in the data model for CPC resources.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: dict


     
log_file
  File path of a log file to which the logic flow of this module as well as interactions with the HMC are logged. If null, logging will be propagated to the Python root logger.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


     
_faked_session
  An internal parameter used for testing the module.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: raw




Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

   
   ---
   # Note: The following examples assume that some variables named 'my_*' are set.

   - name: Gather facts about the CPC
     zhmc_cpc:
       hmc_host: "{{ my_hmc_host }}"
       hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"
       name: "{{ my_cpc_name }}"
       state: facts
     register: cpc1

   - name: Ensure the CPC has the desired property values
     zhmc_cpc:
       hmc_host: "{{ my_hmc_host }}"
       hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"
       name: "{{ my_cpc_name }}"
       state: set
       properties:
         acceptable_status:
          - active
         description: "This is CPC {{ my_cpc_name }}"
