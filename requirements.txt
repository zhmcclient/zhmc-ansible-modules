# Pip requirements file for installation of the project.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance.
#
# Make sure that the minimum versions required in this file are consistent with
# the minimum versions specified in minimum-constraints.txt.


# Direct dependencies (except pip, setuptools, wheel):

# Keep minimum versions consistent with table for 'minimum' packages in development.rst and with minimum-constraints.txt
# Starting with Python 3.9, ansible >=4 is needed.
# ansible 4 requires Python 2.7 or >=3.5.
