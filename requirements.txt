# Pip requirements file for installation of the project.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance.
#
# Make sure that the minimum versions required in this file are consistent with
# the minimum versions specified in minimum-constraints.txt.


# Direct dependencies (except pip, setuptools, wheel):

# Keep minimum ansible versions in sync with minimum-constraints.txt and lowest ansible version in sync with meta/runtime.yml
# Starting with Python 3.9, ansible 4 is needed.
# The sanity check of ansible 4 supports Python only up to 3.9, so Python 3.10 requires ansible 5.
# The sanity check of ansible 5 supports Python only up to 3.10, so Python 3.11 requires ansible 6.
