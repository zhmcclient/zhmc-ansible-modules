# Pip requirements file for install dependencies of the ibm.ibm_zhmc Ansible collection.

# Note: This file is included in the Ansible collection package, and its packages
# need to be installed by the user of this Ansible collection.


# Direct dependencies for install, except ansible/ansible-core (must be consistent with minimum-constraints-install.txt)

# Note: The dependencies to ansible and ansible-core are actually install dependencies, but since Ansible EE does not
# expect dependencies to ansible or ansible-core in the package's requirements file, they have been moved to a separate
# requirements file requirements-ansible.txt that is not part of the Ansible collection package.
