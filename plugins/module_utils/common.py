    Open a session with the HMC and validate session-related parameters.

    This is called by modules in order to communicate with the HMC.

    There are three ways the session can be established:

    * Faked session: If the '_faked_session' item in `params` is present
      and not `None`, a faked (=mocked) session with that
      zhmcclient_mock.FakedSession object is returned, and there is no
      communication with an HMC established. The faked session will not be
      logged off in close_session(). This is used for testing only.

    * HMC session with module-scope logoff: If the 'session_id' item in
      `params` is absent or `None`, a zhmcclient.Session object is
      returned that is set up with a newly created HMC session. That HMC session
      will be logged off in close_session().

    * HMC session with user-controlled logoff: If the 'session_id' item in
      `params` is present and not `None`, a zhmcclient.Session object is
      returned that is set up for this existing HMC session. That HMC session
      will not be logged off in close_session().

    Parameters:
      params (dict): Module parameters, with these items:
        - hmc_host (str): HMC host name or IP address.
        - hmc_auth (dict): Credentials, either with password or session_id.
          In case of a password, a new HMC session is created.
          In case of a session_id, that existing HMC session is used.
        - _faked_session (zhmcclient_mock.FakedSession): Faked session, if
          testing.

    Returns:

    If this function returns, the operational status of the LPAR will be one of

    Parameters:
