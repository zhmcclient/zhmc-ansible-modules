    Ensure that the LPAR is loaded, regardless of what its current operational
    status is.

    If this function returns, the operational status of the LPAR will be one of
    LPAR_LOADED_END_STATUSES.

    Parameters:

      logger (logging.Logger): The logger to be used.

      lpar (zhmcclient.Lpar): The LPAR (must exist, and its
        status property is assumed to be current).

      check_mode (bool): Indicates whether the playbook was run in check mode,
        in which case this method does not actually change the LPAR, but
        just returns what would have been done.

      activation_profile_name (string): The name of the image or load activation
        profile to be used when the LPAR needs to be activated. If None, the
        image or load activation profile specified in the
        'next-activation-profile-name' property of the LPAR is used when the
        LPAR needs to be activated.

        If the LPAR was already active or loaded, the `force` parameter
        determines what happens.

      force (bool): Controls what happens when the LPAR was already active or
        loaded:

        If True, the parameters from the specified or defaulted image or load
        activation profile will be applied.

        If False, the parameters from the previously used activation profile
        remain applied and will not be changed. The previously used activation
        profile is shown in the 'last-used-activation-profile' property of the
        LPAR.

        TODO: Verify the statements in the description of the 'force' parameter.

    Returns:
      bool: Indicates whether the LPAR was changed.

    Raises:

        an operating status despite attempting it.
