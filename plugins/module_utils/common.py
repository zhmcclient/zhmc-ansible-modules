    Process a normal (= non-artificial) property.

    Parameters:

      prop_name (string): Property name (using Ansible module names).

      resource_properties (dict): Dictionary of property definitions for the
        resource type (e.g. ZHMC_PARTITION_PROPERTIES). Each value must be a
        tuple (allowed, create, update, update_while_active, eq_func,
        type_cast). For details, see the modules using this function.

      input_props (dict): New properties.

      resource: zhmcclient resource object (e.g. zhmcclient.Partition) with
        all properties pulled.

    Returns:

      tuple of (create_props, update_props, stop), where:
        * create_props: dict of properties for resource creation.
        * update_props: dict of properties for resource update.
        * deactivate (bool): Indicates whether the resource needs to be
          deactivated because there are properties to be updated that
          require that.

    Raises:
      ParameterError: An issue with the module parameters.
