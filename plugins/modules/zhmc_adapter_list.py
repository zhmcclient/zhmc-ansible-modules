module: zhmc_adapter_list
version_added: "2.9.0"
short_description: List adapters
description:
  - List adapters on a specific CPC (Z system) or on all managed CPCs.
  - CPCs in classic mode are ignored (i.e. do not lead to a failure).
  - Adapters for which the user has no object access permission are ignored
    (i.e. do not lead to a failure).
  - On HMCs with version 2.16.0 or higher, the "List Permitted Adapters"
    operation is used by this module. Otherwise, the managed CPCs are listed
    and then the adapters on each desired CPC or CPCs are listed. This improves
    the execution time of the module on newer HMCs but does not affect the
    module result data.
seealso:
  - module: zhmc_adapter
author:
  - Andreas Maier (@andy-maier)
requirements:
  - "The HMC userid must have object-access permissions to these objects:
    Target adapters, CPCs of target adapters (CPC access is only needed for
    HMC version 2.15 and older)."
options:
  hmc_host:
    description:
      - The hostnames or IP addresses of a single HMC or of a list of redundant
        HMCs. A single HMC can be specified as a string type or as an HMC list
        with one item. An HMC list can be specified as a list type or as a
        string type containing a Python list representation.
      - The first available HMC of a list of redundant HMCs is used for the
        entire execution of the module.
