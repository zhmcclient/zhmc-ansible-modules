module: zhmc_storage_group
version_added: "2.9.0"
short_description: Create storage groups
description:
  - Gather facts about a storage group associated with a CPC (Z system),
    including its storage volumes and virtual storage resources.
  - Create, delete, or update a storage group associated with a CPC.
notes:
  - This module manages only the knowledge of the Z system about its storage,
    but does not perform any actions against the storage subsystems or
    SAN switches attached to the Z system.
  - Attachment of storage groups to and from partitions is managed by the
    Ansible module zhmc_storage_group_attachment.
author:
  - Andreas Maier (@andy-maier)
  - Andreas Scheuring (@scheuran)
  - Juergen Leopold (@leopoldjuergen)
requirements:
  - Access to the WS API of the HMC of the targeted Z system
    (see :term:`HMC API`).
  - The targeted Z system must be of generation z14 or later (to have the
    "dpm-storage-management" firmware feature) and must be in the Dynamic
    Partition Manager (DPM) operational mode.
