short_description: Attach crypto resources to partitions
description:
  - Gather facts about the attachment of crypto adapters and crypto domains to
    a partition of a CPC (Z system).
  - Attach a range of crypto domains and a number of crypto adapters to a
    partition.
  - Detach all crypto domains and all crypto adapters from a partition.
author:

    (see :term:`HMC API`).

    operational mode.
