module: zhmc_partition
version_added: "2.9.0"
short_description: Manage a partition (DPM mode)
description:
  - Gather facts about a partition of a CPC (Z system), including its HBAs,
    NICs, virtual functions, and crypto configuration including crypto
    adapters.
  - Create, update, or delete a partition. The HBAs, NICs, and virtual
   functions of the partition are managed by separate Ansible modules.
  - Start or stop a partition.

requirements:
  - The targeted Z system must be in the Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM)
    operational mode.
  - "The HMC userid must have these task permissions:
    'New Partition', 'Delete Partition', 'Partition Details',
    'Start Partition', 'Stop Partition', 'Dump Partition', 'PSW Restart'."

    Target partitions, CPCs of target partitions, Crypto adapters of target
    partitions."

    Process the properties specified in the 'properties' module parameter,
    and return two dictionaries (create_props, update_props) that contain
    the properties that can be created, and the properties that can be updated,
    respectively. If the resource exists, the input property values are
    compared with the existing resource property values and the returned set
    of properties is the minimal set of properties that need to be changed.

    - Underscores in the property names are translated into hyphens.
    - The presence of read-only properties, invalid properties (i.e. not
      defined in the data model for partitions), and properties that are not
      allowed because of restrictions or because they are auto-created from
      an artificial property is surfaced by raising ParameterError.
    - The properties resulting from handling artificial properties are
      added to the returned dictionaries.

    Parameters:

      cpc (zhmcclient.Cpc): CPC with the partition to be updated, and
        with the adapters to be used for the partition.

      partition (zhmcclient.Partition): Partition to be updated with the full
        set of current properties, or `None` if it did not previously exist.

      params (dict): Module input parameters.

    Returns:
      tuple of (create_props, update_props, stop, crypto_changes), where:
        * create_props: dict of properties for
          zhmcclient.PartitionManager.create()
        * update_props: dict of properties for
          zhmcclient.Partition.update_properties()
        * stop (bool): Indicates whether some update properties require the
          partition to be stopped when doing the update.
        * crypto_changes (tuple): Changes to the crypto configuration if any
          (or `None` if no changes were specified), as a tuple of:
          * remove_adapters: List of Adapter objects to be removed
          * remove_domain_indexes: List of domain indexes to be removed
          * add_adapters: List of Adapter objects to be added
          * add_domain_configs: List of domain configs to be added (dict of
            'domain-index', 'access-mode')
          * change_domain_configs: List of domain configs for changing the
