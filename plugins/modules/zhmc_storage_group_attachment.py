module: zhmc_storage_group_attachment
version_added: "2.9.0"
short_description: Attach storage groups to partitions
description:
  - Gather facts about the attachment of a storage group to a partition of a
    CPC (Z system).
  - Attach and detach a storage group to and from a partition.
notes:
  - This module manages only the knowledge of the Z system about its storage,
    but does not perform any actions against the storage subsystems or
    SAN switches attached to the Z system.
author:
  - Andreas Maier (@andy-maier)
  - Andreas Scheuring (@scheuran)
  - Juergen Leopold (@leopoldjuergen)
requirements:
  - Access to the WS API of the HMC of the targeted Z system
    (see :term:`HMC API`). The targeted Z system must be in the Dynamic
    Partition Manager (DPM) operational mode.
  - The Z system must be of generation z14 or later, to have the
    "dpm-storage-management" firmware feature.
