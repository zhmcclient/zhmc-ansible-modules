module: zhmc_storage_group_attachment
version_added: "2.9.0"
short_description: Attach storage groups to partitions
description:
  - Gather facts about the attachment of a storage group to a partition of a
    CPC (Z system).
  - Attach and detach a storage group to and from a partition.
notes:
  - This module manages only the knowledge of the Z system about its storage,
    but does not perform any actions against the storage subsystems or
    SAN switches attached to the Z system.
author:
  - Andreas Maier (@andy-maier)
  - Andreas Scheuring (@scheuran)
  - Juergen Leopold (@leopoldjuergen)
requirements:
  - The targeted Z system must be of generation z14 or later (to have the
    "dpm-storage-management" firmware feature) and must be in the Dynamic
    Partition Manager (DPM) operational mode.
  - "The HMC userid must have these task permissions:
    'Configure Storage - System Programmer', 'Partition Details'."
  - "The HMC userid must have object-access permissions to these objects:
    Target partitions, target storage groups, target CPCs."
options:
  hmc_host:
    description:
      - The hostnames or IP addresses of a single HMC or of a list of redundant
        HMCs. A single HMC can be specified as a string type or as an HMC list
        with one item. An HMC list can be specified as a list type or as a
        string type containing a Python list representation.
      - The first available HMC of a list of redundant HMCs is used for the
        entire execution of the module.
