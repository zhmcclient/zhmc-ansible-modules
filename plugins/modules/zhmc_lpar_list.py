module: zhmc_lpar_list
version_added: "2.9.0"
short_description: List LPARs
description:
  - List LPARs on a specific CPC (Z system) or on all managed CPCs.
  - CPCs in DPM mode are ignored (i.e. do not lead to a failure).
  - LPARs for which the user has no object access permission are ignored (i.e.
    do not lead to a failure).
  - On HMCs with version 2.14.0 or higher, the "List Permitted Logical
    Partitions" operation is used by this module. Otherwise, the managed CPCs
    are listed and then the LPARs on each desired CPC or CPCs are listed. This
    improves the execution time of the module on newer HMCs but does not affect
    the module result data.
author:
  - Andreas Maier (@andy-maier)
requirements:
  - "The HMC userid must have object-access permissions to these objects:
    Target LPArs, CPCs of target LPARs (only for z13 and older)."
options:
  hmc_host:
    description:
      - The hostnames or IP addresses of a single HMC or of a list of redundant
        HMCs. A single HMC can be specified as a string type or as an HMC list
        with one item. An HMC list can be specified as a list type or as a
        string type containing a Python list representation.
      - The first available HMC of a list of redundant HMCs is used for the
        entire execution of the module.

            in the 'CURL_CA_BUNDLE' environment variable is used, or if neither
            of these variables is set, the certificates in the Mozilla CA
            Certificate List provided by the 'certifi' Python package are used

        instead."
