IBM Z HMC collection
====================

The **IBM Z HMC collection** is part of the broader initiative to bring Ansible
Automation to IBM Z® through the offering
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z®**. The
**IBM Z HMC collection** supports automation tasks such as creating, updating or
deleting partitions and other resources that can be managed with the
IBM Z Hardware Management Console (HMC).

Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z
===========================================

**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z** provides the ability to
connect IBM Z® to clients' wider enterprise automation strategy through the
Ansible Automation Platform ecosystem. This enables development and operations
automation on Z through a seamless, unified workflow orchestration with
configuration management, provisioning, and application deployment in
one easy-to-use platform.

The **IBM Z HMC collection** is following the
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z®** method of distributing
content. Collections will be developed in the open, and when content is ready
for use it is released to
[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/search?keywords=ibm_z&order_by=-relevance&deprecated=false&type=collection&page=1)
for community adoption. Once contributors review community usage, feedback,
and are satisfied with the content published, the collection will then be
released to [Ansible Automation Hub](https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-hub)
as **certified** and **IBM supported** for
**Red Hat® Ansible Automation Platform subscribers**.

For guides and reference, please review the
[documentation](https://zhmcclient.github.io/zhmc-ansible-modules/)
or the Z HMC section in the
[unified documentation](https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/).
