Note: Details on the "Version on Galaxy" badge, below:

Shields.io allows defining dynamic badge creation using data in the result of
an HTTP GET on a JSON based REST API, as follows:

https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?
  url=<URL>&
  label=<LABEL>&
  query=<$.DATA.SUBDATA>&
  color=<COLOR>&
  prefix=<PREFIX>&
  suffix=<SUFFIX>
plus the standard query parameters (style, color, ...)

Ansible Galaxy returns the latest version of a collection using an HTTP GET on
https://galaxy.ansible.com/api/v2/collections/<NS>/<COLL>/ as follows:

{
    . . .
    "latest_version": {
        "version": "1.0.0",
    }
}

Ansible AutomationHub returns the latest version of a collection using an HTTP GET on
https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/v3/collections/<NS>/<COLL>/ as follows:

{
    . . .
    "highest_version": {
        "version": "1.0.0",
    }
}

That would result in the following markup:

[![Version on AutomationHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?style=flat&label=hub&prefix=v&url=https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/v3/collections/ibm/ibm_zhmc/&query=highest_version.version)](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/ibm/ibm_zhmc/ "Version on AutomationHub")

However, for now this does not work, so it has been removed again from the README page.
For details, see the discussion at https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/discussions/202

IBM Z HMC collection
====================

The **IBM Z HMC collection** is part of the broader initiative to bring Ansible
Automation to IBM Z® through the offering
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z®**. The
**IBM Z HMC collection** supports automation tasks such as creating, updating or
deleting partitions and other resources that can be managed with the
IBM Z Hardware Management Console (HMC).

Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z
===========================================

**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z** provides the ability to
connect IBM Z® to clients' wider enterprise automation strategy through the
Ansible Automation Platform ecosystem. This enables development and operations
automation on Z through a seamless, unified workflow orchestration with
configuration management, provisioning, and application deployment in
one easy-to-use platform.

The **IBM Z HMC collection** is following the
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z®** method of distributing
content. Collections will be developed in the open, and when content is ready
for use it is released to
[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/search?keywords=ibm_z&order_by=-relevance&deprecated=false&type=collection&page=1)
for community adoption. Once contributors review community usage, feedback,
and are satisfied with the content published, the collection will then be
released to [Ansible Automation Hub](https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-hub)
as **certified** and **IBM supported** for
**Red Hat® Ansible Automation Platform subscribers**.

For guides and reference, please review the
[documentation](https://zhmcclient.github.io/zhmc-ansible-modules/)
or the Z HMC section in the
[unified documentation](https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/).

Features
========

The **IBM Z HMC collection** provides Ansible modules and

for automating management tasks on the Hardware Management Console (HMC) of
[IBM Z](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/) and
[LinuxONE](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/linuxone/) machines, such as
