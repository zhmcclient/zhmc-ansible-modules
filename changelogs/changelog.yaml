  0.10.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - The new support for verifying HMC certificates will by default verify the
        HMC certificate using the "Mozilla CA Certificate List" provided by the 'certifi'
        Python package, causing self-signed HMC certificates to be rejected. The verification
        behavior can be controlled with the new 'ca_certs' and 'verify' sub-parameters
        of the 'hmc_auth' module parameter of each module.
      bugfixes:
      - docs - Fixed error during automatic docs build when two PRs are merged to
        master shortly one after another. The last one finishing the docs build now
        wins. Since PRs are merged in the order earlier first, their docs build should
        also finish first (issue 417).
      - docs - Fixed instructions to release a version to cover for the case where
        the docs build does not show the new verison in the release notes.
      - docs - Fixed link to ibm_zhmc samples playbooks.
      - docs - Fixed the text for the Ansible Module Index in the bibliography to
        state it applies to Ansible 2.9 and fixed the link to reference the 2.9 version
        instead of the latest version. Added a bibliography entry for the Ansible
        Collection Index for Ansible 2.10 and later.
      - docs - In the development section of the docs, fixes and improvements for
        the descriptions of releasing a version and starting a new version (issues
        344 and 345).
      - docs - Pinned Sphinx to <4.0 to circumvent the issue that sphinx-versions
        uses the deprecated Sphinx.add_stylesheet() method that was removed in Sphinx
        4.0 (issue 402).
      - docs - The docs is now always built from the master branch, and the versions
        to be generated is now automatically determined from the Git tags and branches.
        This fixes a possible inconsistency in the versions included and build parameters
        used, between stable branch and master branch (issue 350).
      - test - Added sanity test ignore file for ansible-core 2.11 and fixed some
        Pylint issues to pass the test.
      - test - Fixed the condition for whether to run the Ansible sanity test and
        fixed issues reported by it (issue 377 and others).
      - test - Mitigated the coveralls HTTP status 422 by pinning coveralls-python
        to <3.0.0.
      major_changes:
      - Added support for verifying HMC certificates by adding module sub-parameters
        'ca_certs' and 'verify' to the 'hmc_auth' module parameter of all modules.
        (issue 401).
      - Changed module input parameter 'hmc_auth.userid' to no longer be hidden in
        logs, for better debugging. The password is still hidden in any logs.
      - docs - Stated that ansible-core 2.11 is supported.
      - docs - The idempotency of each module and possible limitations are now described
        for each module (issue 375).
      minor_changes:
      - Accomodated the immutable properties introduced with zhmcclient 0.31.0.
      - Increased minimum version of zhmcclient to 0.31.0 in order to have the support
        for certificate verification and to pick up fixes.
      - docs - Renamed "Bibliography" page to "Resources" and removed common Ansible
        links from that page to better fit the unified documentation for the IBM Z
        collections.
      - docs - The documentation is now built for all versions since 0.9.0 and for
        the master branch. This change added the update versions before the latest
        update version within each minor version, and removed the latest stable branch
        stable_M.N.
      release_summary: Released on 2021-06-17. Functional enhancements and bug fixes.
        This version contains all fixes up to version 0.9.2.
    release_date: '2021-06-17'
  0.2.0:
    changes:
      release_summary: Released on 2017-07-20. This is the initial release.
    release_date: '2017-07-20'
  0.3.0:
    changes:
      major_changes:
      - Added support for specifying integer-typed and float-typed properties of Partitions,
        NICs, HBAs, and VFs also as decimal strings in the module input.
      - Specifying string typed properties of Partitions, NICs, HBAs, and VFs with
        Unicode characters no longer performs an unnecessary property update.
      minor_changes:
      - Increased minimum ansible version from 2.0.0.1 to 2.2.0.0.
      - Increased minimum zhmcclient version to 0.15.0.
      release_summary: Released on 2017-08-16. Functional enhancements and bug fixes.
    release_date: '2017-08-16'
  0.4.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Improved the logic for handling create+update properties in case the resource
        does not exist, such that they are no longer updated in addition to being
        set during creation. The logic still supports updating as an alternative if
        the resource does not exist, for update-only properties (e.g. several properties
        in Partitions). (Fixed as part of issue 31).
      - zhmc_partition - Fixed that the "type" property for Partitions could not be
        specified. It is valid for Partition creation, and the only restriction is
        that its value cannot be changed once the Partition exists. Along with fixing
        the logic for such create-only properties, the same issue was also fixed for
        the adapter port related properties of HBAs (issue 31).
      - zhmc_partition - Fixed the bug that a TypeError was raised when setting the
        'ssc_dns_servers' property for a Partition. The property value is a list of
        strings, and lists of values were not supported previously. Extended the function
        test cases for partitions accordingly (issue 34).
      - zhmc_partition - Fixed the issue that a partition in "terminated" or "paused"
        status could not be made absent (i.e. deleted). Now, the partition is stopped
        which should bring it into "stopped" status, and then deleted (issue 29).
      major_changes:
      - zhmc_partition - Added support for gathering partition and child facts. The
        fact support is invoked by specifying state=facts. The fact support is implemented
        by returning the partition properties in the result. The returned partition
        properties are enriched by adding properties 'hbas', 'nics', 'virtual-functions'
        that are a list of the properties of the respective child elements of that
        partition. (issue 32).
      minor_changes:
      - Added get_facts.py script to examine usage of the Ansible 2.0 API.
      release_summary: Released on 2018-03-15. Functional enhancements and bug fixes.
    release_date: '2018-03-15'
  0.5.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - development - Changed 'make setup' back to 'make develop' for consistency
        with the other zhmcclient projects.
      bugfixes:
      - development - Several fixes in the make process and package dependencies.
      major_changes:
      - Added support for DPM storage groups, attachments and volumes, by adding new
        modules 'zhmc_storage_group', 'zhmc_storage_group_attachment', and 'zhmc_storage_volume'.
        Added several playbooks as examples.
      minor_changes:
      - Synced package dependencies with zhmcclient project.
      release_summary: Released on 2018-10-24. Functional enhancements and bug fixes.
    release_date: '2018-10-24'
  0.6.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Added support for Python 3.7. This required increasing the minimum version
        of Ansible from 2.2.0.0 to 2.4.0.0. This also removes the dependency on the
        'pycrypto' package, which has vulnerabilities and is no longer maintained
        since 2013. Ansible uses the 'cryptography' package, instead.  See issue 66.
      - Fixed dependency to zhmcclient package to be >=0.20.0, instead of using its
        master branch from the github repo.
      - 'Updated the ''requests'' package to 2.20.0 to fix the following vulnerability:
        https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18074.'
      - zhmc_adapter - The `crypto_number` property of Adapter is an integer property,
        and thus the Ansible module `zhmc_adapter` needs to change the string passed
        by Ansible back to an integer. It did that correctly but only for the `properties`
        input parameter, and not for the `match` input parameter. The type conversions
        are now applied for all properties of Adapter also for the `match` parameter.
      - zhmc_cpc - The dictionary to check input properties for the `zhmc_cpc` module
        had the `acceptable_status` property written with a hyphen instead of underscore.
        This had the effect that it was rejected as non-writeable when specifying
        it as input.
      major_changes:
      - docs - Improved and fixed the documentation how to release a version and how
        to start a new version.
      - zhmc_adapter - Added support for managing adapters by adding a `zhmc_adapter`
        Ansible module. The module allows setting writeable properties of an adapter,
        changing the adapter type for FICON Express adapters, and changing the crypto
        type for Crypto Express adapters, all in an idempotent way. It also allows
        gathering facts for an adapter (i.e. all of its properties including a few
        artificial ones). See issue 83.
      - zhmc_cpc - Added support for managing CPCs by adding a `zhmc_cpc` Ansible
        module. The module allows setting writeable properties of a CPC in an idempotent
        way, and to gather facts for a CPC (i.e. all of its properties including a
        few artificial ones). See issue 82.
      - zhmc_crypto_attachment - Added a `zhmc_crypto_attachment` Ansible module,
        which manages the attachment of crypto adapters and of crypto domains to partitions
        in an idempotent way. This was already supported in a less flexible and non-idempotent
        way by the `zhmc_partition` Ansible module.
      - zhmc_partition - Added support for adjusting the value of the `ssc_ipv4_gateway`
        input property for the `zhmc_partition` module to `None` if specified as the
        empty string. This allows defaulting the value more easily in playbooks.
      release_summary: Released on 2019-01-07. Functional enhancements and bug fixes.
        Fixed this change log in 0.6.1 and 0.7.0
    release_date: '2019-01-07'
  0.7.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - zhmc_adapter - Temporarily disabled the retrieval of full properties in the
        result data of the zhmc_adapter module.
      major_changes:
      - 'Renovated the logging: Added support for the log_file parameter to all modules.
        Changed the format of the log lines. Set log level also when no log_file is
        specified, causing the logs to be propagated to the root logger.'
      minor_changes:
      - docs - Fixed change log of 0.6.0.
      release_summary: Released on 2019-02-20. Functional enhancements and bug fixes.
    release_date: '2019-02-20'
  0.8.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - zhmc_crypto_attachment - Fixed an issue where the incorrect crypto adapter
        was picked, leading to a subsequent crypto conflict when starting the partition.
        See issue 112.
      minor_changes:
      - zhmc_crypto_attachment - Improved the quaity of error messages.
      release_summary: Released on 2019-04-02. Functional enhancements and bug fixes.
    release_date: '2019-04-02'
  0.9.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - Fixed the 'version_added' field in the module description to no longer indicate
        the version of this module collection package, but instead the minimum Ansible
        version supported, consistent with the definition of that field. Since Ansible
        Galaxy supports Ansible 2.9 and above, the field now shows 2.9 for all modules.
      - The zhmc Ansible collection is no longer distributed as the `zhmc-ansible-modules
        package on Pypi <https://pypi.org/project/zhmc-ansible-modules/>`_, but as
        the `ibm.ibm_zhmc collection on Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ibm/ibm_zhmc/>`_.
      bugfixes:
      - Fixed ParameterError raised when creating NICs on CNA adapter ports.
      - dev - Increased minimum version of flake8 to 3.7.0 due to difficulties with
        recognizing certain 'noqa' statements. This required explicitly specifying
        its dependent pycodestyle and pyflakes packages with their minimum versions,
        because the dependency management did not work with our minimum package versions.
      - docs - In the description of the module return data, added samples and fixed
        errors in the described structure of return data for the modules `zhmc_adapter`,
        `zhmc_cpc`, `zhmc_storage_group` and `zhmc_user`.
      - zhmc_adapter - Fixed AttributeError when using the zhmc_adapter module to
        create a HiperSockets adapter (see issue 141).
      - zhmc_storage_group, zhmc_user - Fixed issues with parameters in exception
        messages raised in zhmc_storage_group and zhmc_user.
      major_changes:
      - Added support for Python 3.7 and 3.8.
      - dev - Migrated from Travis and Appveyor to GitHub Actions. This required several
        changes in package dependencies for development.
      - examples - Added an example playbook 'get_cpc_io.yml' which retrieves information
        about a CPC in DPM mode and its I/O configuration and creates a markdown file
        showing the result.
      - test - Added end2end test support, against real HMCs.
      - zhmc_cpc - Added an artificial property 'storage-groups' to the output that
        shows the storage groups attached to the partition, with only a subset of
        their properties.
      - zhmc_cpc - Clarified that the zhmc_cpc module can be used for CPCs in any
        operational mode. Previously, the documentation stated DPM mode as a prerequisite.
        Added support to the zhmc_cpc module for updating several classic-mode-only
        properties.
      - zhmc_crypto_attachment - Added support for specifying crypto adapters by name
        instead of just their count (see issue 187).
      - zhmc_nic - Updated the definition of NIC properties to the z15 machine generation.
        This makes the 'mac_address' property writeable, and adds the 'vlan_type',
        'function_number' and 'function_range' properties.
      - zhmc_partition - Added an artificial property 'crypto-adapters' to the 'crypto-configuration'
        property, showing the adapter properties of the crypto adapters attached to
        the partition, with all of their properties and artificial properties as in
        the result of zhmc_adapter. This is enabled by the new boolean input parameter
        'expand_crypto_adapters'.
      - zhmc_partition - Added an artificial property 'storage-groups' to the output
        that shows the storage groups attached to the partition, with all of their
        properties and artificial properties as in the result of zhmc_storage_group.
        This is enabled by the new boolean input parameter 'expand_storage_groups'.
      - 'zhmc_partition - Added artificial properties to the ''nics'' property: ''adapter-name'':
        Name of the adapter backing the NIC. ''adapter-port'': Port index on the adapter
        backing the NIC. ''adapter-id'': Adapter ID (PCHID) of the adapter backing
        the NIC.'
      - zhmc_user - Added a new module `zhmc_user` for managing users on the HMC.
      minor_changes:
      - dev - Changed make targets and adjusted to directory structure compatible
        with Ansible collections, and for publishing on Ansible Galaxy.
      - dev - Dropped the use of pbr for this package.
      - dev - Removed old circumventions for Travis issues.
      - docs - Removed the page describing common return values, because all return
        values are specifically described on the module pages without referencing
        any common return value type.
      - docs - Updated maintainer list.
      - 'examples - Moved the sample playbooks to the common IBM Z Ansible Collection
        Samples repository: https://github.com/IBM/z_ansible_collections_samples/.'
      release_summary: Released on 2020-12-14. Functional enhancements and bug fixes.
        This version contains all fixes up to version 0.8.3.
      removed_features:
      - Dropped support for Python 3.4.
    release_date: '2020-12-14'
  1.0.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Improved handling of exceptions when creation of zhmcclient.Session fails.
        (issue 451).
      - Increased minimum version of zhmcclient from 0.31.0 to 1.2.0 in order to pick
        up fixes and new functionality.
      - Increased the minimum versions of the requests, cryptography, and PyYAML packages
        due to fixes requires for Python 3.10, and also due to the new package dependency
        resolver in Pip.
      - docs - Increased minimum version of Sphinx to 4.1.0 to fix an issue with renamed
        filters in Jinja2 3.1.0.
      - docs, dev - Pinned voluptous to <0.13.0 on Python 2.7. Increased sphinx-versions
        to 1.1.3.post-am2 for fix for Click 8.1.0 (issue 488).
      - test - Fixed new Pylint issues reported by Pylint 2.9 and 2.10.
      major_changes:
      - Added support for Ansible 5.0.
      - Added support for Python 3.10, but needed to exclude the Ansible sanity test
        for the time being, since it does not yet support Python 3.10.
      - zhmc_cpc - Added state values 'active' and 'inactive' for activating/starting
        and deactivating/stopping CPCs in their current operational mode (issue 418).
      - zhmc_lpar - Added a new zhmc_lpar Ansible module for managing LPARs on CPCs
        in classic mode (issue 418).
      release_summary: Released on 2022-04-08. Functional enhancements and bug fixes.
        This version contains all fixes up to version 0.10.1.
    release_date: '2022-04-08'
  1.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Added a tag 'infrastructure' to the collection metadata (tags field in galaxy.yml)
        - Ansible Automation Hub requires at least one tag from a standard tag list
        to be specified.
      - Increased minimum version of zhmcclient from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0 in order to pick
        up fixes and new functionality.
      - dev - Added "make check" for running "flake8" since the "pep8" that is run
        as part of the ansible sanity test does not find some issues. Resolved those
        new issues.
      - docs - Fixed incorrect input property names in zhmc_user module (part of issue
        514).
      - test - Added missing env.vars in the pytest invocation for end2end tests.
      - test - Added missing optional module parameters in the end2end tests.
      - test - Added support for specifying 'hmc_auth.ca_certs' and 'hmc_auth.verify'
        from the 'hmc_verify_cert' parameter in the HMC definition file in end2end
        test cases for zhmc_partition and zhmc_user.
      - test - Fixed failure of sanity test on Python 3.6 due to new CryptographyDeprecationWarning
        raised by ansible, by pinning cryptography to <37.0.0 on Python 3.6 (issue
        518).
      - test - Removed the "tools" directory from the temporary archive built for
        the sanity test, and removed the ignore statements for "tools/os_setup.sh"
        from the ignore files because the sanity test on AutomationHub tests against
        the uploaded archive which does not have that script.
      - zhmc_user - Fixed an error for users with LDAP authentication.
      - zhmc_user - Fixed incorrect default properties for users created in check
        mode.
      - zhmc_user - Fixed the use of incorrectly named attributes and methods in the
        zhmc_user module, and made the module result in check mode consistent with
        non-check mode (issue 507).
      major_changes:
      - test - Added support for a TESTCASES env.var for filtering testcases with
        the pytest -k option.
      - test - Made end2end testing compatible with zhmcclient.testutils support using
        an Ansible compatible HMC inventory file and an Ansible compatible HMC vault
        file. The default HMC inventory file is now ~/.zhmc_inventory.yaml and can
        be changed using the TESTINVENTORY env. var. The default HMC vault file is
        now ~/.zhmc_vault.yaml and can be changed using the TESTVAULT env. var. The
        default HMC or group to run the end2end tests against is now 'default' and
        can be changed using the TESTHMC env. var.
      - zhmc_user - Added support for specifying user roles as input in the zhmc_user
        module. User roles can now be specified with their names. They had been displayed
        on users before (issue 514).
      - zhmc_user - Removed check in zhmc_user module for required input properties
        'type' and 'authentication_type' because for updating existing users they
        are not needed, and for creating new users, the HMC checks these (part of
        issue 514).
      release_summary: Released on 2022-06-01. Functional enhancements and bug fixes.
        This version contains all fixes up to version 1.0.3.
    release_date: '2022-06-01'
  1.2.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fixed that every module invocation created an additional log handler, thus
        duplicating log entries. This only affected the end2end tests, but not when
        used in Ansible playbooks (issue 552).
      - Improved error handling when the zhmcclient_mock module is missing. (issue
        574).
      - Increased minimum version of zhmcclient to 1.5.0 in order to pick up fixes
        (part of issue 396).
      - dev - Fixed a flake8 AttributeError when using importlib-metadata 5.0.0 on
        Python >=3.7, by pinning importlib-metadata to <5.0.0 on these Python versions.
      - docs - Updated the set of supported Ansible versions listed in the Installation
        section of the documentation to add recent Ansible versions up to Ansible
        7.
      - test - Added missing z14 partition properties to the mock definition file
        tests/end2end/mocked_hmc_z14.yaml (related to issue 550).
      - test - Temporarily disabled the sanity tests on all Ansible 7 (ansible-core
        2.14) test environments. See issue 579 for the overall issue.
      - zhmc_adapter - Made the zhmc_adapter module tolerant against unconfigured
        FICON adapters to avoid HTTP error 404,4 "Get for Storage Port Properties
        is not supported for this card type" (issue 580).
      - zhmc_partition - Added missing z14, z15 and z16 input properties 'boot_storage_volume',
        'boot_storage_volume_name', 'boot_load_parameters', 'permit_ecc_key_import_functions',
        'ssc_ipv6_gateway', 'secure_boot', 'secure_execution', 'storage_group_uris',
        'tape_link_uris', 'partition_link_uris', 'available_features_list' (related
        to issue 550).
      - zhmc_partition - Fixed that the artificial property 'boot-storage-volume-name'
        was not included in the result (related to issue 550).
      - zhmc_partition - Fixed the support for check mode and added tests (issue 550).
      - zhmc_user - Made the zhmc_user module tolerant against unusual cases such
        as local auth without password rule (issue 564).
      major_changes:
      - docs - Simplified the publishing of the collection.

        z114 / zEC12 / zBC12.
      - test - Added a new make target 'end2end_mocked' that runs the end2end tests
        against mock environments defined with a new HMC inventory file (mocked_inventory.yaml)
        and a new HMC vault file (mocked_vault.yaml), and new mock files mocked_z14_classic.yaml
        and mocked_z14_dpm.yaml (part of issue 396).
      - test - Added support for Ansible 6.0.0 by adding an ignore-2.13.txt file to
        the sanity tests (issue 533).
      - test - Added tests for Python 3.11.
      - test - Added the end2end_mocked tests to the coverage data reported to coveralls.io.
      - test - Increased the set of tested Ansible versions to now include all major
        versions that are supported, from Ansible 2.9 to Ansible 7.
      - test - Merged function tests into end2end tests to remove duplicate test cases.
      - zhmc_adapter_list - Added a new 'zhmc_adapter_list' Ansible module for listing
        adapters on CPCs in DPM mode. This speeds up execution time compared to obtaining
        them from the facts returned by 'zhmc_cpc' (issue 576).
      - zhmc_lpar - Added support for 'reset_clear' and 'reset_normal' state in the
        zhmc_lpar module to support the "Reset Clear" and "Reset Normal" HMC operations.

      - zhmc_partition_list, zhmc_lpar_list - Removed the restriction that the 'se-version'
        property in the result of the zhmc_partition_list and zhmc_lpar_list modules
        was provided only with HMC versions 2.14.1 and newer. The property is now
        provided with all HMC versions. (issue 549).
      - zhmc_partition_list, zhmc_lpar_list - Removed the restriction that the zhmc_partition_list
        and zhmc_lpar_list modules were supported only with HMC versions 2.14.0 and
        newer. These modules are now supprted with all HMC versions (issue 549).
      - zhmc_password_rule - Added a new module 'zhmc_password_rule' that supports
        creating/updating, deleting, and gathering facts of a password rule on the
        HMC (issue 363).
      - zhmc_password_rule_list - Added a new module 'zhmc_password_rule_list' that
        supports listing the names of password rules on the HMC (issue 363).
      - zhmc_user - Improved the error handling of the zhmc_user module when specified
        user roles, user patterns, password rules, or LDAP server definitions do not
        exist (related to issue 564).
      - zhmc_user_role - Added a new module 'zhmc_user_role' that supports creating/updating,
        deleting, and gathering facts of a user role on the HMC (issue 362).
      - zhmc_user_role_list - Added a new module 'zhmc_user_role_list' that supports
        listing the names of user roles on the HMC (issue 362).

    release_date: '2022-12-06'
  1.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Unpinned Ansible again. It was pinned in version 1.2.0 on each Python version
        to a different Ansible version in order to broaden the test coverage. The
        test coverage across Ansible versions is now defined separately from the Ansible
        versions required for installing the collection.
      major_changes:
      - zhmc_user_list - Added a new module 'zhmc_user_list' for listing the HMC users.
      minor_changes:
      - docs, dev - Changed sphinx-versions to use the PEP 440 compliant tag 1.1.3.post2
        from our fork.
      - test - Addressed issues in test workflow reported by Github Actions (issue
        616).
      release_summary: Released on 2023-03-03. Functional enhancements and bug fixes.

    release_date: '2023-03-03'
  1.4.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - dev - Circumvented the removal of Python 2.7 from the Github Actions plugin
        setup-python, by using the Docker container python:2.7.18-buster instead,
        and by adjusting the os_setup.sh script to accomodate the absence of sudo
        in that container. As part of that, Python 2.7 on macOS is no longer tested.
      - test - Fixed a bug when displaying details on failed end2end testcases in
        test_zhmc_password_rule.py and test_zhmc_user.py.
      deprecated_features:
      - zhmc_user - Deprecated the 'expand' input parameter of the 'zhmc_user' module.
        It had been used to expand URLs to independent objects (user roles, password
        rule, LDAP server definitions) leading to returning the same objects multiple
        times when invoking the 'zhmc_user' module in a loop (related to issue 658).
      major_changes:
      - Added support for Ansible version 8 (ansible-core 2.15).
      - dev - Added package dependency checking for the remaining Python-based tools
        that are used in the development of this colleciton.
      - dev - Added safety checking and addressed any reported issues (issue 632).
      - docs - Added a troubleshooting section to the docs.
      - zhmc_console - Added a new 'zhmc_console' module that provides facts about
        the targeted HMC. (issue 650).
      - zhmc_nic - Added support for "state=facts" to the zhmc_nic module (issue 671).
      - zhmc_nic_list - Added a new zhmc_nic_list module for lising the NICs of a
        partition. (issue 671).
      - zhmc_session - Added a new 'zhmc_session' module for maintaining the HMC session
        across playbook/role tasks. This can be used to reduce the number of HMC sessions
        that is created during playbook execution, to one. Without this module, each
        ibm_zhmc module invocation creates its own separate HMC session. Along with
        that, added a new 'session_id' input parameter to all existing Ansible modules,
        that can be provided as an alternative to providing userid and password.
      - zhmc_user - The 'zhmc_user' module with 'state=facts' now returns the artificial
        name properties always consistent with the presence of the corresponding uri
        properties (related to issue 658).
      - zhmc_user, zhmc_user_role - Improved performance of the 'zhmc_user' and 'zhmc_user_role'
        modules for 'state=facts' (issues 660, 658).
      minor_changes:
      - Increased minimum versions of pip, setuptools, wheel to more recent versions.
      - Increased version of cryptography package to 41.0.0 on Python >=3.7.
      release_summary: Released on 2023-06-22. Functional enhancements and bug fixes.

    release_date: '2023-06-22'
  1.5.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Addressed safety issues from 6+7/2023, by increasing 'requests' to 2.31.0
        on Python >=3.7, and 'cryptography' to 41.0.2 on Python >=3.7, and by increasing
        other packages only needed for development.
      - Increased minimum version of cryptography package to 41.0.2 to address an
        issue.
      - Increased minimum version of zhmcclient to 1.9.1 to get fixes. This required
        upgrading several other packages.
      - zhmc_nic_list - Fixed issue in the new zhmc_nic_list module that resulted
        in TypeError.
      major_changes:
      - dev - Documented the secret variables needed for the Github Actions workflows.
      - zhmc_storage_group - Added support for FCP discovery to the zhmc_storage_group
        module with a new state 'discover' (issue 704).

        'upgrade' (issue 719).
      - zhmc_cpc - Added support for upgrading the SE firmware with a new state value
        'upgrade' (issue 719).
      minor_changes:
      - Increased minimum version of zhmcclient to 1.10.0 to pick up the functionality
        for upgrading firmware (issue 719).
      release_summary: Released on 2023-08-04. Functional enhancements and bug fixes.
