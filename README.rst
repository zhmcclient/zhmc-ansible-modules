Moving to Ansible Galaxy
========================

Starting with version 0.9.0, the zhmc Ansible modules are no longer distributed
as the
`zhmc-ansible-modules package on Pypi <https://pypi.org/project/zhmc-ansible-modules/>`_,
but as the
`ibm.ibm_zhmc collection on Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ibm/ibm_zhmc/>`_.

Overview
========

The zhmc-ansible-modules Python package contains `Ansible`_ modules that can
manage platform resources on `IBM Z`_ and `LinuxONE`_ machines that are in
the Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM) operational mode.

The goal of this package is to be able to utilize the power and ease of use
of Ansible for the management of IBM Z platform resources.

The IBM Z resources that can be managed include Partitions, HBAs, NICs, and
Virtual Functions.

The Ansible modules in the zhmc-ansible-modules package are fully
`idempotent <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/glossary.html#term-idempotency>`_,
following an important principle for Ansible modules.

The idempotency of a module allows Ansible playbooks to specify the desired end
state for a resource, regardless of what the current state is. For example, a
IBM Z partition can be specified to have ``state=active`` which means that
it must exist and be in the active operational status. Depending on the current
state of the partition, actions will be taken by the module to reach this
desired end state: If the partition does not exist, it will be created and
started. If it exists but is not active, it will be started. If it is already
active, nothing will be done. Other initial states including transitional
states such as starting or stopping also will be taken care of.

The idempotency of modules makes Ansible playbooks restartable: If an error
happens and some things have been changed already, the playbook can simply be
re-run and will automatically do the right thing, because the initial state
does not matter for reaching the desired end state.

The Ansible modules in the zhmc-ansible-modules package are written in Python
and interact with the Web Services API of the Hardware Management Console (HMC)
of the machines to be managed, by using the API of the `zhmcclient`_ Python
package.

Playbook examples
=================

Here are some examples for using the Ansible modules in this project:

Create a stopped partition
--------------------------

This task ensures that a partition with this name exists, is in the stopped
status and has certain property values.

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - hosts: localhost
      tasks:
      - name: Ensure a partition exists and is stopped
        zhmc_partition:
          hmc_host: "10.11.12.13"
          hmc_auth: "{{ hmc_auth }}"
          cpc_name: P000S67B
          name: "my partition 1"
          state: stopped
          properties:
            description: "zhmc Ansible modules: partition 1"
            ifl_processors: 2
            initial_memory: 1024
            maximum_memory: 1024
            minimum_ifl_processing_weight: 50
            maximum_ifl_processing_weight: 800
            initial_ifl_processing_weight: 200
            ... # all partition properties are supported

Start a partition
-----------------

If this task is run after the previous one shown above, no properties need to
be specified. If it is possible that the partition first needs to be created,
then properties would be specified, as above.

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - hosts: localhost
      tasks:
      - name: Ensure a partition exists and is active
        zhmc_partition:
          hmc_host: "10.11.12.13"
          hmc_auth: "{{ hmc_auth }}"
          cpc_name: P000S67B
          name: "my partition 1"
          state: active
          properties:
            ... # see above

Delete a partition
------------------

This task ensures that a partition with this name does not exist. If it
currently exists, it is stopped (if needed) and deleted.

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - hosts: localhost
      tasks:
      - name: Ensure a partition does not exist
        zhmc_partition:
          hmc_host: "10.11.12.13"
          hmc_auth: "{{ hmc_auth }}"
          cpc_name: P000S67B
          name: "my partition 1"
          state: absent

Create an HBA in a partition
----------------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---

          hmc_host: "10.11.12.13"
          hmc_auth: "{{ hmc_auth }}"
          cpc_name: P000S67B
          partition_name: "my partition 1"
          name: "hba 1"
          state: present
          properties:
            adapter_name: "fcp 1"
            adapter_port: 0
            description: The HBA to our storage
            device_number: "023F"
            ... # all HBA properties are supported

Create a NIC in a partition
---------------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - hosts: localhost
      tasks:
      - name: Ensure NIC exists in the partition
        zhmc_nic:
          hmc_host: "10.11.12.13"
          hmc_auth: "{{ hmc_auth }}"
          cpc_name: P000S67B
          partition_name: "my partition 1"
          name: "nic 1"
          state: present
          properties:

      - name: Ensure virtual function for zEDC adapter exists in the partition
        zhmc_virtual_function:
          hmc_host: "10.11.12.13"
          hmc_auth: "{{ hmc_auth }}"
          cpc_name: P000S67B
          partition_name: "my partition 1"
          name: "vf 1"
          state: present
          properties:
            adapter_name: "zedc 1"

Quickstart
==========

For installation instructions, see `Installation of zhmc-ansible-modules package
<http://zhmc-ansible-modules.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html#installation>`_.

After having installed the zhmc-ansible-modules package, you can download and
run the example playbooks in `folder 'playbooks' of the Git repository
<https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-ansible-modules/tree/master/playbooks>`_:

* ``create_partition.yml`` creates a partition with a NIC, HBA and virtual
  function to an accelerator adapter.

* ``delete_partition.yml`` deletes a partition.

* ``vars_example.yml`` is an example variable file defining variables such as
  CPC name, partition name, etc.

* ``vault_example.yml`` is an example password vault file defining variables
  for authenticating with the HMC.

Before you run a playbook, copy ``vars_example.yml`` to ``vars.yml`` and
``vault_example.yml`` to ``vault.yml`` and change the variables in those files
as needed.

Then, run the example playbooks:

.. code-block:: text

    $ ansible-playbook create_partition.yml
