# Ansible versions to test on

# Keep minimum and latest versions consistent with table for 'ansible' packages in development.rst
# ansible 8 (ansible-core 2.15) requires Python >=3.9 and its sanity test supports Python 3.9 to 3.11.
# ansible 9 (ansible-core 2.16) requires Python >=3.10 and its sanity test supports Python 3.10 to 3.12.
# ansible 10 (ansible-core 2.17) requires Python >=3.10 and its sanity test supports Python 3.10 to 3.12.
# ansible 11 (ansible-core 2.18) requires Python >=3.11 and its sanity test supports Python 3.11 to 3.13.
# ansible 12 (ansible-core 2.19) requires Python >=3.11 and its sanity test supports Python 3.11 to 3.13.
# Ansible 8 requires Python >=3.9 - this is the check that no Python version below 3.9 is used.

# Indirect dependencies are not specified in this file, unless needed to solve versioning issues:

# Jinja2 is used by ansible/ansible-core and by ansible-doc-extractor.
# The module.rst.j2 template used by ansible-doc-extractor uses the 'tojson' filter added in Jinja2 2.9
# Ansible 6 requires Jinja2>=3.0
# Python 3.10 requires Jinja>=2.11
Jinja2==3.1.6

# MarkupSafe is used by Jinja2
# Jinja2 3.0 requires MarkupSafe>=2.0
MarkupSafe==2.0.0


# Direct dependencies for development (must be consistent with requirements-develop.txt)
