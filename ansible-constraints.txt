# Make sure that the constraints defined in this file are consistent with

# Ansible versions to test on

# Keep minimum and latest versions consistent with table for 'ansible' packages in development.rst
ansible>=6.0.0,<7; python_version == '3.8'           # Ansible 6.x / ansible-core 2.13
ansible>=7.0.0,<8; python_version == '3.9'           # Ansible 7.x / ansible-core 2.14
ansible>=8.0.0,<9; python_version == '3.10'          # Ansible 8.x / ansible-core 2.15

ansible>=10.0.1; python_version >= '3.12'            # Ansible 10.x and higher / ansible-core 2.17


# Indirect dependencies are not specified in this file, unless needed to solve versioning issues:

# Jinja2 is used by ansible/ansible-core and by ansible-doc-extractor.
# The module.rst.j2 template used by ansible-doc-extractor uses the 'tojson' filter added in Jinja2 2.9
# Ansible 6 requires Jinja2>=3.0
# Python 3.10 requires Jinja>=2.11
Jinja2==3.1.3

# MarkupSafe is used by Jinja2
# Jinja2 3.0 requires MarkupSafe>=2.0
MarkupSafe==2.0.0


# Direct dependencies for development (must be consistent with dev-requirements.txt)

# ansible-test
yamllint==1.25.0; python_version <= '3.9'
yamllint==1.26.3; python_version >= '3.10'
pathspec==0.9.0
rstcheck==3.3.1; python_version <= '3.9'  # ansible <= 2.10 (on minimum package levels)
