Maintenance
===========

To clarify who maintains each included module, adding features and fixing bugs, each included module now has associated metadata that provides information about maintenance.

Core
----

:ref:`Core Maintained<core_supported>` modules are maintained by the Ansible Engineering Team.
These modules are integral to the basic foundations of the Ansible distribution.

Network
-------

:ref:`Network Maintained<network_supported>` modules are are maintained by the Ansible Network Team. Please note there are additional networking modules that are categorized as Certified or Community not maintained by Ansible.


Certified
---------

`Certified <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3642632>`_ modules are maintained by Ansible Partners.

Community
---------

:ref:`Community Maintained<community_supported>` modules are submitted and maintained by the Ansible community.  These modules are not maintained by Ansible, and are included as a convenience.

Issue Reporting
===============

If you believe you have found a bug in a module and are already running the latest stable or development version of Ansible, first look at the `issue tracker in the Ansible repo <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues>`_ to see if an issue has already been filed. If not, please file one.

Should you have a question rather than a bug report, inquiries are welcome on the `ansible-project Google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/ansible-project>`_ or on Ansible's "#ansible" channel, located on irc.freenode.net.

For development-oriented topics, use the `ansible-devel Google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/ansible-devel>`_ or Ansible's #ansible and #ansible-devel channels, located on irc.freenode.net. You should also read the :ref:`Community Guide <ansible_community_guide>`, :ref:`Testing Ansible <developing_testing>`, and the :ref:`Developer Guide <developer_guide>`.

The modules are hosted on GitHub in a subdirectory of the `Ansible <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/lib/ansible/modules>`_ repo.

NOTE: If you have a Red Hat Ansible Automation product subscription, please follow the standard issue reporting process via the `Red Hat Customer Portal <https:///access.redhat.com/>`_.
