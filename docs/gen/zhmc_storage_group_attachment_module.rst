Examples

    # Note: The following examples assume that some variables named 'my_*' are set.

    - name: Gather facts about the attachment
      zhmc_storage_group_attachment:

        hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"

        storage_group_name: "{{ my_storage_group_name }}"
        partition_name: "{{ my_partition_name }}"
        state: facts

    - name: Ensure the storage group is attached to the partition
      zhmc_storage_group_attachment:

    - name: "Ensure the storage group is not attached to the partition."

Return Values
-------------

Common return values are documented here :doc:`common_return_values`, the following are the fields unique to this module:

.. raw:: html

    <table border=1 cellpadding=4>

    <tr>
    <th class="head">name</th>
    <th class="head">description</th>
    <th class="head">returned</th>
    <th class="head">type</th>
    <th class="head">sample</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>storage_group_attachment</td>
    <td>
        <div>A dictionary with a single key &#x27;attached&#x27; whose boolean value indicates whether the storage group is now actually attached to the partition. If check mode was requested, the actual (i.e. not the desired) attachment state is returned.</div>
    </td>
    <td align=center>success</td>
    <td align=center>dict</td>
    <td align=center><code>{&quot;attached&quot;: true}</code>
    </td>
    </tr>

    </table>
    </br>
    </br>

Notes
-----

.. note::
    - The CPC that is associated with the target storage group must be in the Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM) operational mode and must have the "dpm-storage-management" firmware feature enabled. That feature has been introduced with the z14-ZR1 / Rockhopper II machine generation.
    - This module performs actions only against the Z HMC regarding the attachment of storage group objects to partitions. This module does not perform any actions against storage subsystems or SAN switches.
    - The Ansible module zhmc_hba is no longer used on CPCs that have the "dpm-storage-management" feature enabled.
