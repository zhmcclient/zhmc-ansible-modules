Examples

    # Note: The following examples assume that some variables named 'my_*' are set.

    - name: Gather facts about a storage group
      zhmc_storage_group:

        hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"

Return Values
-------------

Common return values are documented here :doc:`common_return_values`, the following are the fields unique to this module:

    <table border=1 cellpadding=4>

    <tr>
    <th class="head">name</th>
    <th class="head">description</th>
    <th class="head">returned</th>
    <th class="head">type</th>
    <th class="head">sample</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>storage_group</td>
    <td>
        <div>For <code>state=absent</code>, an empty dictionary.</div>
        <div>For <code>state=present|facts</code>, a dictionary with the resource properties of the target storage group, plus additional artificial properties as described in the following list items. The dictionary keys are the exact property names as described in the data model for the resource, i.e. they contain hyphens (-), not underscores (_). The dictionary values are the property values using the Python representations described in the documentation of the zhmcclient Python package. The additional artificial properties are:</div>
        <div>* <code>attached-partition-names</code>: List of partition names to which the storage group is attached.</div>
        <div>* <code>cpc-name</code>: Name of the CPC that is associated to this storage group.</div>
        <div>* <code>candidate-adapter-ports</code> (only if expand was requested): List of candidate adapter ports of the storage group. Each port is represented as a dictionary of its properties; in addition each port has an artificial property <code>parent-adapter</code> which represents the adapter of the port. Each adapter is represented as a dictionary of its properties.</div>
        <div>* <code>storage-volumes</code> (only if expand was requested): List of storage volumes of the storage group. Each storage volume is represented as a dictionary of its properties.</div>
        <div>* <code>virtual-storage-resources</code> (only if expand was requested): List of virtual storage resources of the storage group. Each virtual storage resource is represented as a dictionary of its properties.</div>
        <div>* <code>attached-partitions</code> (only if expand was requested): List of partitions to which the storage group is attached. Each partition is represented as a dictionary of its properties.</div>
        <div>* <code>cpc</code> (only if expand was requested): The CPC that is associated to this storage group. The CPC is represented as a dictionary of its properties.</div>

    <td align=center>dict</td>
    <td align=center><code>{
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;sg-1&quot;,

    </td>

Notes
-----

.. note::
    - The CPC that is associated with the target storage group must be in the Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM) operational mode and must have the "dpm-storage-management" firmware feature enabled. That feature has been introduced with the z14-ZR1 / Rockhopper II machine generation.
    - This module performs actions only against the Z HMC regarding the definition of storage group objects and their attachment to partitions. This module does not perform any actions against storage subsystems or SAN switches.
    - Attachment of a storage group to and from partitions is managed by the Ansible module zhmc_storage_group_attachment.
    - The Ansible module zhmc_hba is no longer used on CPCs that have the "dpm-storage-management" feature enabled.
