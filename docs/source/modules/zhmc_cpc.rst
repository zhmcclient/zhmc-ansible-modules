zhmc_cpc -- Manage CPCs
=======================



.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------
- Deactivate/Stop a CPC (Z system).
- Activate/Start a CPC and update its properties.
- Gather facts about a CPC, and for DPM operational mode, including its adapters, partitions and storage groups.
- Update the properties of a CPC.
- Upgrade the SE firmware of a CPC.


Requirements
------------

- The HMC userid must have these task permissions: 'CPC Details'. For CPCs in DMP mode: 'Start', 'Stop'. For CPCs in classic mode: 'Activate', 'Deactivate'.
- The HMC userid must have object-access permissions to these objects: Target CPCs. For CPCs in DMP mode: Adapters, partitions, storage groups of target CPCs. For CPCs in classic mode: LPARs, activation profiles of target CPCs.




Parameters
----------


hmc_host
  The hostname or IP address of the HMC.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


hmc_auth
  The authentication credentials for the HMC.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: dict


  userid
    The userid (username) for authenticating with the HMC. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`session\_id`\ .

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  password
    The password for authenticating with the HMC. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`session\_id`\ .

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  session_id
    HMC session ID to be used. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`userid`\  and \ :literal:`password`\  and can be created as described in :ref:\`zhmc\_session\_module\`.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  ca_certs
    Path name of certificate file or certificate directory to be used for verifying the HMC certificate. If null (default), the path name in the 'REQUESTS\_CA\_BUNDLE' environment variable or the path name in the 'CURL\_CA\_BUNDLE' environment variable is used, or if neither of these variables is set, the certificates in the Mozilla CA Certificate List provided by the 'certifi' Python package are used for verifying the HMC certificate.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  verify
    If True (default), verify the HMC certificate as specified in the \ :literal:`ca\_certs`\  parameter. If False, ignore what is specified in the \ :literal:`ca\_certs`\  parameter and do not verify the HMC certificate.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: bool
    | **default**: True



name
  The name of the target CPC.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


state
  The desired state for the CPC. All states are fully idempotent within the limits of the properties that can be changed:

  \* \ :literal:`inactive`\ : Ensures the CPC is inactive.

  \* \ :literal:`active`\ : Ensures the CPC is active and then ensures that the CPC has the specified properties. The operational mode of the CPC cannot be changed.

  \* \ :literal:`set`\ : Ensures that the CPC has the specified properties.

  \* \ :literal:`facts`\ : Returns the CPC properties including its child resources.

  \* \ :literal:`upgrade`\ : Upgrades the firmware of the SE of the CPC and returns the new facts after the upgrade. If the SE firmware is already at the requested bundle level, nothing is changed and the module succeeds.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str
  | **choices**: inactive, active, set, facts, upgrade


activation_profile_name
  The name of the reset activation profile to be used when activating the CPC in the classic operational mode, for \ :literal:`state=active`\ . This parameter is ignored when the CPC is in classic mode and was already active, and when the CPC is in DPM mode.

  Default: The reset activation profile specified in the 'next-activation-profile-name' property of the CPC.

  This parameter is not allowed for the other \ :literal:`state`\  values.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


properties
  Only for \ :literal:`state=set`\  and \ :literal:`state=active`\ : New values for the properties of the CPC. Properties omitted in this dictionary will remain unchanged. This parameter will be ignored for other \ :literal:`state`\  values.

  The parameter is a dictionary. The key of each dictionary item is the property name as specified in the data model for CPC resources, with underscores instead of hyphens. The value of each dictionary item is the property value (in YAML syntax). Integer properties may also be provided as decimal strings.

  The possible properties in this dictionary are the properties defined as writeable in the data model for CPC resources.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: dict


bundle_level
  Name of the bundle to be installed on the SE of the CPC (e.g. 'S71')

  Required for \ :literal:`state=upgrade`\ 

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


accept_firmware
  Accept the previous bundle level before installing the new level.

  Optional for \ :literal:`state=upgrade`\ , default: True

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool
  | **default**: True


log_file
  File path of a log file to which the logic flow of this module as well as interactions with the HMC are logged. If null, logging will be propagated to the Python root logger.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str
