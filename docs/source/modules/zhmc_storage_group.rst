zhmc_storage_group -- Create storage groups
===========================================



.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------
- Gather facts about a storage group associated with a CPC (Z system), including its storage volumes and virtual storage resources.
- Create, delete, or update a storage group associated with a CPC.





Parameters
----------


hmc_host
  The hostname or IP address of the HMC.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


hmc_auth
  The authentication credentials for the HMC, as a dictionary of ``userid``, ``password``.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: dict


  userid
    The userid (username) for authenticating with the HMC.

    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str


  password
    The password for authenticating with the HMC.

    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str



cpc_name
  The name of the CPC associated with the target storage group.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


name
  The name of the target storage group.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


state
  The desired state for the target storage group:

  * ``absent``: Ensures that the storage group does not exist. If the storage group is currently attached to any partitions, the module will fail.

  * ``present``: Ensures that the storage group exists and is associated with the specified CPC, and has the specified properties. The attachment state of the storage group to a partition is not changed.

  * ``facts``: Does not change anything on the storage group and returns the storage group properties.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str
  | **choices**: absent, present, facts


properties
  Dictionary with desired properties for the storage group. Used for ``state=present``; ignored for ``state=absent|facts``. Dictionary key is the property name with underscores instead of hyphens, and dictionary value is the property value in YAML syntax. Integer properties may also be provided as decimal strings.

  The possible input properties in this dictionary are the properties defined as writeable in the data model for Storage Group resources (where the property names contain underscores instead of hyphens), with the following exceptions:

  * ``name``: Cannot be specified because the name has already been specified in the ``name`` module parameter.

  * ``type``: Cannot be changed once the storage group exists.

  Properties omitted in this dictionary will remain unchanged when the storage group already exists, and will get the default value defined in the data model for storage groups in the :term:`HMC API` when the storage group is being created.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: dict


expand
  Boolean that controls whether the returned storage group contains additional artificial properties that expand certain URI or name properties to the full set of resource properties (see description of return values of this module).

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool


log_file
  File path of a log file to which the logic flow of this module as well as interactions with the HMC are logged. If null, logging will be propagated to the Python root logger.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str




Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

   
   ---
   # Note: The following examples assume that some variables named 'my_*' are set.

   - name: Gather facts about a storage group
     zhmc_storage_group:
       hmc_host: "{{ my_hmc_host }}"
       hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"
       cpc_name: "{{ my_cpc_name }}"
       name: "{{ my_storage_group_name }}"
       state: facts
       expand: true
     register: sg1

   - name: Ensure the storage group does not exist
     zhmc_storage_group:
       hmc_host: "{{ my_hmc_host }}"
       hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"
       cpc_name: "{{ my_cpc_name }}"
       name: "{{ my_storage_group_name }}"
       state: absent

   - name: Ensure the storage group exists
     zhmc_storage_group:
       hmc_host: "{{ my_hmc_host }}"
       hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"
       cpc_name: "{{ my_cpc_name }}"
       name: "{{ my_storage_group_name }}"
       state: present
       expand: true
       properties:
         description: "Example storage group 1"
         type: fcp
         shared: false
         connectivity: 4
         max-partitions: 1
     register: sg1





Notes
-----

.. note::
   This module manages only the knowledge of the Z system about its storage, but does not perform any actions against the storage subsystems or SAN switches attached to the Z system.

   Attachment of storage groups to and from partitions is managed by the Ansible module zhmc_storage_group_attachment.







Return Values
-------------


changed
  Indicates if any change has been made by the module. For ``state=facts``, always will be false.

  | **returned**: always
  | **type**: bool

msg
  An error message that describes the failure.

  | **returned**: failure
  | **type**: str

storage_group
  For ``state=absent``, an empty dictionary.

  For ``state=present|facts``, the resource properties of the target storage group after any changes, plus additional artificial properties as described below.

  | **returned**: success
  | **type**: dict
  | **sample**:
