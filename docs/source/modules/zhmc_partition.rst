zhmc_partition -- Create partitions
===================================



.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------
- Gather facts about a partition of a CPC (Z system), including its HBAs, NICs, and virtual functions.
- Create, update, or delete a partition. The HBAs, NICs, and virtual functions of the partition are managed by separate Ansible modules.
- Start or stop a partition.





Parameters
----------


hmc_host
  The hostname or IP address of the HMC.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


hmc_auth
  The authentication credentials for the HMC, as a dictionary of userid, password.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: dict


  userid
    The userid (username) for authenticating with the HMC.

    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str


  password
    The password for authenticating with the HMC.

    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str



cpc_name
  The name of the CPC with the target partition.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


name
  The name of the target partition.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


state
  The desired state for the target partition:

  ``absent``: Ensures that the partition does not exist in the specified CPC.

  ``stopped``: Ensures that the partition exists in the specified CPC, has the specified properties, and is in the 'stopped' status.

  ``active``: Ensures that the partition exists in the specified CPC, has the specified properties, and is in the 'active' or 'degraded' status.

  ``facts``: Does not change anything on the partition and returns the partition properties and the properties of its child resources (HBAs, NICs, and virtual functions).

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str
  | **choices**: absent, stopped, active, facts


properties
  Dictionary with input properties for the partition, for ``state=stopped`` and ``state=active``. Key is the property name with underscores instead of hyphens, and value is the property value in YAML syntax. Integer properties may also be provided as decimal strings. Will be ignored for ``state=absent``.

  The possible input properties in this dictionary are the properties defined as writeable in the data model for Partition resources (where the property names contain underscores instead of hyphens), with the following exceptions:

  * ``name``: Cannot be specified because the name has already been specified in the ``name`` module parameter.

  * ``type``: Cannot be changed once the partition exists, because updating it is not supported.

  * ``boot_storage_device``: Cannot be specified because this information is specified using the artificial property ``boot_storage_hba_name``.

  * ``boot_network_device``: Cannot be specified because this information is specified using the artificial property ``boot_network_nic_name``.

  * ``boot_storage_hba_name``: The name of the HBA whose URI is used to construct ``boot_storage_device``. Specifying it requires that the partition exists.

  * ``boot_network_nic_name``: The name of the NIC whose URI is used to construct ``boot_network_device``. Specifying it requires that the partition exists.

  * ``crypto_configuration``: The crypto configuration for the partition, in the format of the ``crypto-configuration`` property of the partition (see :term:`HMC API` for details), with the exception that adapters are specified with their names in field ``crypto_adapter_names`` instead of their URIs in field ``crypto_adapter_uris``. If the ``crypto_adapter_names`` field is null, all crypto adapters of the CPC will be used.

  Properties omitted in this dictionary will remain unchanged when the partition already exists, and will get the default value defined in the data model for partitions in the :term:`HMC API` when the partition is being created.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: dict


expand_storage_groups
  Boolean that controls whether the returned partition contains an additional artificial property 'storage-groups' that is the list of storage groups attached to the partition, with properties as described for the zhmc_storage_group module with expand=true.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool


expand_crypto_adapters
  Boolean that controls whether the returned partition contains an additional artificial property 'crypto-adapters' in its 'crypto-configuration' property that is the list of crypto adapters attached to the partition, with properties as described for the zhmc_adapter module.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool


log_file
  File path of a log file to which the logic flow of this module as well as interactions with the HMC are logged. If null, logging will be propagated to the Python root logger.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


_faked_session
  An internal parameter used for testing the module.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: raw

   # Note: The following examples assume that some variables named 'my_*' are set.

   # Because configuring LUN masking in the SAN requires the host WWPN, and the
   # host WWPN is automatically assigned and will be known only after an HBA has
   # been added to the partition, the partition needs to be created in stopped
   # state. Also, because the HBA has not yet been created, the boot
