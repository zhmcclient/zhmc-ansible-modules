===========================================================



.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------
- Retrieve version and feature facts for the targeted HMC and its managed CPCs.


Requirements
------------

- No specific task or object-access permissions are required.




Parameters
----------


hmc_host
  The hostnames or IP addresses of a single HMC or of a list of redundant HMCs. A single HMC can be specified as a string type or as an HMC list with one item. An HMC list can be specified as a list type or as a string type containing a Python list representation.

  The first available HMC of a list of redundant HMCs is used for the entire execution of the module.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: raw


hmc_auth
  The authentication credentials for the HMC.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: dict


  userid
    The userid (username) for authenticating with the HMC. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`hmc\_auth.session\_id`\ .

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  password
    The password for authenticating with the HMC. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`hmc\_auth.session\_id`\ .

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  session_id
    HMC session ID to be used. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`hmc\_auth.userid`\  and \ :literal:`hmc\_auth.password`\  and can be created as described in the \ :ref:`zhmc\_session module <zhmc_session_module>`\ .

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  ca_certs
    Path name of certificate file or certificate directory to be used for verifying the HMC certificate. If null (default), the path name in the \ :envvar:`REQUESTS\_CA\_BUNDLE`\  environment variable or the path name in the \ :envvar:`CURL\_CA\_BUNDLE`\  environment variable is used, or if neither of these variables is set, the certificates in the Mozilla CA Certificate List provided by the 'certifi' Python package are used for verifying the HMC certificate.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  verify
    If True (default), verify the HMC certificate as specified in the \ :literal:`hmc\_auth.ca\_certs`\  parameter. If False, ignore what is specified in the \ :literal:`hmc\_auth.ca\_certs`\  parameter and do not verify the HMC certificate.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: bool
    | **default**: True



cpc_names
  List of CPC names for which facts are to be included in the result.

  Default: All managed CPCs.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: list
  | **elements**: str


log_file
  File path of a log file to which the logic flow of this module as well as interactions with the HMC are logged. If null, logging will be propagated to the Python root logger.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str




Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

   
   ---
   # Note: The following examples assume that some variables named 'my_*' are set.

   - name: Retrieve version and feature information for HMC and all managed CPCs
     zhmc_versions:
       hmc_host: "{{ my_hmc_host }}"
       hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"
     register: hmc1

   - name: Retrieve version and feature information for HMC only
     zhmc_versions:
       hmc_host: "{{ my_hmc_host }}"
       hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"
       cpc_names: []
     register: hmc1
