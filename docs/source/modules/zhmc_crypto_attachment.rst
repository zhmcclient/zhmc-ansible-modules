zhmc_crypto_attachment -- Attach crypto resources to partitions
===============================================================



.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------
- Gather facts about the attachment of crypto adapters and crypto domains to a partition of a CPC (Z system).
- Attach a range of crypto domains and a number of crypto adapters to a partition.
- Detach all crypto domains and all crypto adapters from a partition.


Requirements
------------

- The targeted Z system must be in the Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM) operational mode.
- The HMC userid must have these task permissions: 'Partition Details'.
- The HMC userid must have object-access permissions to these objects: Target partitions, target crypto adapters, CPC with target partitions and adapters.




Parameters
----------


hmc_host
  The hostname or IP address of the HMC.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


hmc_auth
  The authentication credentials for the HMC.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: dict


  userid
    The userid (username) for authenticating with the HMC.

    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str


  password
    The password for authenticating with the HMC.

    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str


  ca_certs
    Path name of certificate file or certificate directory to be used for verifying the HMC certificate. If null (default), the path name in the 'REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE' environment variable or the path name in the 'CURL_CA_BUNDLE' environment variable is used, or if neither of these variables is set, the certificates in the Mozilla CA Certificate List provided by the 'certifi' Python package are used for verifying the HMC certificate.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  verify
    If True (default), verify the HMC certificate as specified in the ``ca_certs`` parameter. If False, ignore what is specified in the ``ca_certs`` parameter and do not verify the HMC certificate.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: bool
    | **default**: True



cpc_name
  The name of the CPC that has the partition and the crypto adapters.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


partition_name
  The name of the partition to which the crypto domains and crypto adapters are attached.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


state
  The desired state for the crypto attachment. All states are fully idempotent within the limits of the properties that can be changed:

  * ``attached``: Ensures that the specified number of crypto adapters of the specified crypto type, and the specified range of domain index numbers in the specified access mode are attached to the partition.

  * ``detached``: Ensures that no crypto adapter and no crypto domains are attached to the partition.

  * ``facts``: Returns the crypto configuration of the partition.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str
  | **choices**: attached, detached, facts


adapter_count
  Only for ``state=attached``: The number of crypto adapters the partition needs to have attached. The special value -1 means all adapters of the desired crypto type in the CPC. The ``adapter_names`` and ``adapter_count`` parameters are mutually exclusive; if neither is specified the default for ``adapter_count`` applies.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: int
  | **default**: -1


adapter_names
  Only for ``state=attached``: The names of the crypto adapters the partition needs to have attached. The ``adapter_names`` and ``adapter_count`` parameters are mutually exclusive; if neither is specified the default for ``adapter_count`` applies.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: list
  | **elements**: str


domain_range
  Only for ``state=attached``: The domain range the partition needs to have attached, as a tuple of integers (min, max) that specify the inclusive range of domain index numbers. Other domains attached to the partition remain unchanged. The special value -1 for the max item means the maximum supported domain index number.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: list
  | **elements**: int
  | **default**: [0, -1]


access_mode
  Only for ``state=attached``: The access mode in which the crypto domains specified in ``domain_range`` need to be attached.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str
  | **default**: usage
  | **choices**: usage, control


crypto_type
  Only for ``state=attached``: The crypto type of the crypto adapters that will be considered for attaching.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str
  | **default**: ep11
  | **choices**: ep11, cca, acc


log_file
  File path of a log file to which the logic flow of this module as well as interactions with the HMC are logged. If null, logging will be propagated to the Python root logger.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str
