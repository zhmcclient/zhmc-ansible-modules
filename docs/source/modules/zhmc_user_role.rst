zhmc_user_role -- Create HMC user roles
=======================================



.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------
- Gather facts about a user role on an HMC of a Z system.
- Create, delete, or update a user role on an HMC.


Requirements
------------

- The HMC userid must have these task permissions: 'Manage User Roles'.




Parameters
----------


hmc_host
  The hostnames or IP addresses of a single HMC or of a list of redundant HMCs. A single HMC can be specified as a string type or as an HMC list with one item. An HMC list can be specified as a list type or as a string type containing a Python list representation.

  The first available HMC of a list of redundant HMCs is used for the entire execution of the module.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: raw


hmc_auth
  The authentication credentials for the HMC.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: dict


  userid
    The userid (username) for authenticating with the HMC. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`session\_id`\ .

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  password
    The password for authenticating with the HMC. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`session\_id`\ .

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  session_id
    HMC session ID to be used. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`userid`\  and \ :literal:`password`\  and can be created as described in :ref:\`zhmc\_session\_module\`.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  ca_certs
    Path name of certificate file or certificate directory to be used for verifying the HMC certificate. If null (default), the path name in the 'REQUESTS\_CA\_BUNDLE' environment variable or the path name in the 'CURL\_CA\_BUNDLE' environment variable is used, or if neither of these variables is set, the certificates in the Mozilla CA Certificate List provided by the 'certifi' Python package are used for verifying the HMC certificate.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  verify
    If True (default), verify the HMC certificate as specified in the \ :literal:`ca\_certs`\  parameter. If False, ignore what is specified in the \ :literal:`ca\_certs`\  parameter and do not verify the HMC certificate.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: bool
    | **default**: True



name
  The name of the target user role.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


state
  The desired state for the HMC user role. All states are fully idempotent within the limits of the properties that can be changed:

  \* \ :literal:`absent`\ : Ensures that the user role does not exist.

  \* \ :literal:`present`\ : Ensures that the user role exists and has the specified properties.

  \* \ :literal:`facts`\ : Returns the user role properties.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str
  | **choices**: absent, present, facts


properties
  Dictionary with desired properties for the user role. Used for \ :literal:`state=present`\ ; ignored for \ :literal:`state=absent|facts`\ . Dictionary key is the property name with underscores instead of hyphens, and dictionary value is the property value in YAML syntax. Integer properties may also be provided as decimal strings.

  The possible input properties in this dictionary are the properties defined as writeable in the data model for user role resources (where the property names contain underscores instead of hyphens), with the following exceptions:

  \* \ :literal:`name`\ : Cannot be specified because the name has already been specified in the \ :literal:`name`\  module parameter.

  \* \ :literal:`associated\_system\_defined\_user\_role\_uri`\ : Cannot be specified because this information is specified using the artificial property \ :literal:`associated\_system\_defined\_user\_role\_name`\ .

  \* \ :literal:`associated\_system\_defined\_user\_role\_name`\ : The name of the associated system-defined user role.

  \* \ :literal:`permissions`\ : Can be specified as if it were writeable.

  Properties omitted in this dictionary will remain unchanged when the user role already exists, and will get the default value defined in the data model for user roles in the :term:\`HMC API\` when the user role is being created.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: dict


  {property}
    Any other property defined as writeable in the data model for user role resources (where the property names contain underscores instead of hyphens), except those excluded in the description above.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  associated_system_defined_user_role_name
    The name of the associated system-defined user role. Specifying it requires that the referenced user role exists.

    Optional, default: 'hmc-operator-tasks'.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  permissions
    The permissions for this user role.

    This property is represented different from its description in the :term:\`HMC API\`: The property is a list of permissions. Each list item is a dictionary that specifies a single permission item, any required scoping items, and optional option items.

      | **required**: False
      | **type**: bool

      | **required**: False
      | **type**: str


    group
      Permission item: Object permission to the group with the specified name and optionally to its members.

      | **required**: False

      | **required**: False
      | **type**: bool


    cpc
      Permission item: Object permission to the CPC with the specified name.

      Scoping item: Specifies the CPC name as a scope for the names specified in other permission items.

      | **required**: False
      | **type**: str


    partition
      Permission item: Object permission to the partition with the specified name on the specified CPC (in DPM mode).

      Requires \ :literal:`cpc`\  to be specified as a scoping item.
