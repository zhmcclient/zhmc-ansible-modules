zhmc_user -- Create HMC users
=============================



.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------
- Gather facts about a user on an HMC of a Z system.
- Create, delete, or update a user on an HMC.


Requirements
------------

- The HMC userid must have these task permissions: 'Manage Users' (for standard users), 'Manage User Templates' (for template users).
- For updating its own HMC password, it is sufficient if the HMC userid has task permission for Manage Users or object-access permission for its own User object.




Parameters
----------


hmc_host
  The hostname or IP address of the HMC.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


hmc_auth
  The authentication credentials for the HMC.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: dict


  userid
    The userid (username) for authenticating with the HMC.

    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str


  password
    The password for authenticating with the HMC.

    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str


  ca_certs
    Path name of certificate file or certificate directory to be used for verifying the HMC certificate. If null (default), the path name in the 'REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE' environment variable or the path name in the 'CURL_CA_BUNDLE' environment variable is used, or if neither of these variables is set, the certificates in the Mozilla CA Certificate List provided by the 'certifi' Python package are used for verifying the HMC certificate.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  verify
    If True (default), verify the HMC certificate as specified in the ``ca_certs`` parameter. If False, ignore what is specified in the ``ca_certs`` parameter and do not verify the HMC certificate.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: bool
    | **default**: True



name
  The userid of the target user (i.e. the 'name' property of the User object).

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


state
  The desired state for the HMC user. All states are fully idempotent within the limits of the properties that can be changed:

  * ``absent``: Ensures that the user does not exist.

  * ``present``: Ensures that the user exists and has the specified properties.

  * ``facts``: Returns the user properties.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str
  | **choices**: absent, present, facts


properties
  Dictionary with desired properties for the user. Used for ``state=present``; ignored for ``state=absent|facts``. Dictionary key is the property name with underscores instead of hyphens, and dictionary value is the property value in YAML syntax. Integer properties may also be provided as decimal strings.

  The possible input properties in this dictionary are the properties defined as writeable in the data model for User resources (where the property names contain underscores instead of hyphens), with the following exceptions:

  * ``name``: Cannot be specified because the name has already been specified in the ``name`` module parameter.

  * ``type``: Cannot be changed once the user exists.

  * ``user_roles``: Cannot be set directly, but indirectly via the artificial property ``user_role_names`` which replaces the current user roles, if specified.

  * ``user_pattern_uri``: Cannot be set directly, but indirectly via the artificial property ``user_pattern_name``.

  * ``password_rule_uri``: Cannot be set directly, but indirectly via the artificial property ``password_rule_name``.

  * ``ldap_server_definition_uri``: Cannot be set directly, but indirectly via the artificial property ``ldap_server_definition_name``.

  * ``default_group_uri``: Cannot be set directly, but indirectly via the artificial property ``default_group_name``.

  Properties omitted in this dictionary will remain unchanged when the user already exists, and will get the default value defined in the data model for users in the :term:`HMC API` when the user is being created.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: dict


expand
  Boolean that controls whether the returned user contains additional artificial properties that expand certain URI or name properties to the full set of resource properties (see description of return values of this module).

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool


log_file
  File path of a log file to which the logic flow of this module as well as interactions with the HMC are logged. If null, logging will be propagated to the Python root logger.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str

       name: "{{ my_user_name }}"
       state: absent

   - name: Ensure the user exists and has certain roles
     zhmc_user:
       hmc_host: "{{ my_hmc_host }}"
       hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"
       name: "{{ my_user_name }}"
       state: present
       expand: true
       properties:
         description: "Example user 1"
         type: standard
         authentication_type: local
         password_rule_name: Basic
         password: foobar
         user_role_names:
           - hmc-access-administrator-tasks
           - hmc-all-system-managed-objects

Return Values
-------------


changed

  | **returned**: always
  | **type**: bool

msg
  An error message that describes the failure.

  | **returned**: failure
  | **type**: str

user
  For ``state=absent``, an empty dictionary.

  For ``state=present|facts``, a dictionary with the resource properties of the target user, plus additional artificial properties as described in the following list items.

  | **returned**: success
  | **type**: dict
  | **sample**:
