Synopsis
--------
- List CPCs (Z systems). By default, only the CPCs managed by the targeted HMC are listed. Optionally, unmanaged CPCs can be listed in addition.


Requirements
------------

- The HMC userid must have object-access permissions to these objects: Target CPCs.




Parameters
----------

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


hmc_auth
  The authentication credentials for the HMC.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: dict


  userid
    The userid (username) for authenticating with the HMC. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`session\_id`\ .

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  password
    The password for authenticating with the HMC. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`session\_id`\ .

  session_id
    HMC session ID to be used. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`userid`\  and \ :literal:`password`\  and can be created as described in :ref:\`zhmc\_session\_module\`.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  ca_certs
    Path name of certificate file or certificate directory to be used for verifying the HMC certificate. If null (default), the path name in the 'REQUESTS\_CA\_BUNDLE' environment variable or the path name in the 'CURL\_CA\_BUNDLE' environment variable is used, or if neither of these variables is set, the certificates in the Mozilla CA Certificate List provided by the 'certifi' Python package are used for verifying the HMC certificate.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  verify
    If True (default), verify the HMC certificate as specified in the \ :literal:`ca\_certs`\  parameter. If False, ignore what is specified in the \ :literal:`ca\_certs`\  parameter and do not verify the HMC certificate.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: bool
    | **default**: True



include_unmanaged_cpcs

full_properties
  If True, all properties of each CPC will be returned. Default: False.

  Note: Setting this to True causes a loop of 'Get CPC Properties' operations to be executed.
