zhmc_adapter_list -- List adapters
==================================



.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------
- List adapters on a specific CPC (Z system) or on all managed CPCs.
- CPCs in classic mode are ignored (i.e. do not lead to a failure).
- Adapters for which the user has no object access permission are ignored (i.e. do not lead to a failure).
- On HMCs with version 2.16.0 or higher, the "List Permitted Adapters" operation is used by this module. Otherwise, the managed CPCs are listed and then the adapters on each desired CPC or CPCs are listed. This improves the execution time of the module on newer HMCs but does not affect the module result data.


Requirements
------------

- The HMC userid must have object-access permissions to these objects: Target adapters, CPCs of target adapters (CPC access is only needed for HMC version 2.15 and older).




Parameters
----------


hmc_host
  The hostname or IP address of the HMC.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


hmc_auth
  The authentication credentials for the HMC.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: dict


  userid
    The userid (username) for authenticating with the HMC. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`session\_id`\ .

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  password
    The password for authenticating with the HMC. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`session\_id`\ .

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  session_id
    HMC session ID to be used. This is mutually exclusive with providing \ :literal:`userid`\  and \ :literal:`password`\  and can be created as described in :ref:\`zhmc\_session\_module\`.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  ca_certs
    Path name of certificate file or certificate directory to be used for verifying the HMC certificate. If null (default), the path name in the 'REQUESTS\_CA\_BUNDLE' environment variable or the path name in the 'CURL\_CA\_BUNDLE' environment variable is used, or if neither of these variables is set, the certificates in the Mozilla CA Certificate List provided by the 'certifi' Python package are used for verifying the HMC certificate.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


  verify
    If True (default), verify the HMC certificate as specified in the \ :literal:`ca\_certs`\  parameter. If False, ignore what is specified in the \ :literal:`ca\_certs`\  parameter and do not verify the HMC certificate.

    | **required**: False
    | **type**: bool
    | **default**: True



cpc_name
  Name of the CPC for which the adapters are to be listed.

  Default: All managed CPCs.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


name
  Regular expression pattern for the adapter name to filter the result list to matching adapters.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


adapter_id
  Regular expression pattern for the adapter ID (PCHID) ('adapter-id' property) to filter the result list to matching adapters.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


adapter_family
  Adapter family ('adapter-family' property) to filter the result list to adapters with that family.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


type
  Adapter type ('type' property) to filter the result list to adapters with that type.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


status
  Adapter status ('status' property) to filter the result list to adapters with that status.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


additional_properties
  List of additional properties to be returned for each adapter, in addition to the default properties (see result description).

  Mutually exclusive with \ :literal:`full\_properties`\ .

  The property names are specified with underscores instead of hyphens.

  On HMCs with an API version below 4.10 (= HMC version 2.16.0 with some post-GA updates), all properties of each adapter will be returned if this parameter is specified, but you should not rely on that.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: list
  | **elements**: str


full_properties
  If True, all properties of each adapter will be returned. Default: False.

  Mutually exclusive with \ :literal:`additional\_properties`\ .

  Note: Setting this to True causes a loop of 'Get Adapter Properties' operations to be executed. It is preferrable from a performance perspective to use the \ :literal:`additional\_properties`\  parameter instead.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool


log_file
  File path of a log file to which the logic flow of this module as well as interactions with the HMC are logged. If null, logging will be propagated to the Python root logger.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str




Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

   
   ---
   # Note: The following examples assume that some variables named 'my_*' are set.

   - name: List all permitted adapters on all managed CPCs
     zhmc_adapter_list:
       hmc_host: "{{ my_hmc_host }}"
       hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"
     register: adapter_list

   - name: List all permitted adapters on a CPC
     zhmc_adapter_list:
       hmc_host: "{{ my_hmc_host }}"
       hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"
       cpc_name: CPCA
     register: adapter_list

   - name: List the permitted FICON adapters on a CPC
     zhmc_adapter_list:
       hmc_host: "{{ my_hmc_host }}"
       hmc_auth: "{{ my_hmc_auth }}"
       cpc_name: CPCA
       adapter_family: "ficon"
