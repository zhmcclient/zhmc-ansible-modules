Managed node
============

The managed node for the **IBM Z HMC collection** is the targeted HMC. The
Z systems managed by the HMC are not visible on the network because the HMC
encapsulates them. In addition, there is a number of resources that are owned
by the HMC itself, such as users or password rules.

Requirements for the targeted HMC are:

* The HMC must have its Web Services API enabled.
