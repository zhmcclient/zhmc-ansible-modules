====================
IBM Z HMC collection
====================

The **IBM Z HMC collection** provides `Ansible`_ modules that can manage platform
resources on `IBM Z`_ and `LinuxONE`_ machines.

The goal of this collection is to be able to utilize the power and ease of use
of Ansible for the management of IBM Z platform resources.

The IBM Z platform resources that can be managed include for example partitions,
I/O adapters, the Z system itself, or various resources on its Hardware
Management Console (HMC).

The Ansible modules in this collection are fully
`idempotent <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/glossary.html#term-idempotency>`_,
following an important principle for Ansible modules.
The idempotency of a module allows Ansible playbooks to specify the desired end
state for a resource, regardless of what the current state is. For example, an
IBM Z partition can be specified to have ``state=active`` which means that
it must exist and be in the active operational status. Depending on the current
state of the partition, actions will be taken by the module to reach this
desired end state: If the partition does not exist, it will be created and
started. If it exists but is not active, it will be started. If it is already
active, nothing will be done. Other initial states including transitional
states such as starting or stopping also will be taken care of.
The idempotency of modules makes Ansible playbooks restartable: If an error
happens and some things have been changed already, the playbook can simply be
re-run and will automatically do the right thing, because the initial state
does not matter for reaching the desired end state.

The Ansible modules in this collection are written in Python and interact with
the Web Services API of the Hardware Management Console (HMC) of the Z machines
to be managed.

Note: Before version 0.9.0, the Ansible modules in this collection have been
distributed as the `zhmc-ansible-modules package on Pypi`_.
Starting with version 0.9.0, the Ansible modules are no longer distributed on
Pypi, but as the `ibm.ibm_zhmc collection on Ansible Galaxy`_.

Note that at this point, version 0.9.0 has not been released yet, so please
continue using the latest released version on Pypi.

Features
========

The **IBM Z HMC collection** includes :ref:`modules` to automate the management
of IBM Z platform resources. There are sample :ref:`playbooks` that show how to
invoke these modules in playbook tasks.
