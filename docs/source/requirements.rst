Requirements
============

Ansible playbook tasks using modules from the **IBM Z HMC collection** must
be configured to run on the control node (= local host). From there, the
modules communicate remotely with the WS API of the targeted HMCs.

There are multiple approaches on how this can be configured:

* The recommended approach uses an Ansible inventory and delegation of the tasks
  to localhost, by specifying ``connection: local`` for the playbook or
  ``ansible_connection: local`` in the inventory, and
  ``delegate_to: localhost`` for each task that uses a module of the
  **IBM Z HMC collection**.

* A simpler but more limited approach uses no Ansible inventory and specifies
  ``connection: local`` and ``hosts: localhost`` for the entire playbook.

For more details on these approaches, see the description and sample playbooks
in `IBM Z HMC Sample Playbooks`_.

Control node
============

Requirements for the Ansible control node are:

* The control node must have network connectivity to the targeted HMC.
