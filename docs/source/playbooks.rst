Playbooks
=========

An `Ansible playbook`_ consists of organized instructions that define work for
a managed node (hosts) to be managed with Ansible. In case of the
**IBM Z HMC collection**, the managed node is the local host, and the IP address
of the HMC is specified as an input parameter to the Ansible modules.
