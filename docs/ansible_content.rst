Z HMC
=====

The **IBM Z® HMC collection**, also represented as
`ibm_zhmc`_ in this document, is  part of the broader
initiative to bring Ansible® Automation to IBM Z through the offering
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z**.

The **IBM Z HMC collection** provides `Ansible`_ modules that can manage
platform resources on `IBM Z`_ and `LinuxONE`_ machines. The IBM Z platform
resources that can be managed include for example partitions,
I/O adapters, the Z system itself, or various resources on its Hardware
Management Console (HMC).

The Ansible modules in this collection are written in Python and interact with
the Web Services API of the Hardware Management Console (HMC) of the Z machines
to be managed.
